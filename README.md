# ActualFactualML -- James Lucas's and Isaac Boyd's Repo for Fall CSCI446 Project

Clean Code = working code

Project1CSCI447 = commented code showing process to get to answer

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ToDo list:

#1 Implement 10-fold cross validation.

#2 Do robustness experiment

#3 Implement confusion matrix and get other measurements of accuracy besides accuracy

#4 Start Paper

#5 Start Video

Questions:

Should we implement a grid search for optimal hyper parameters and then graph the output on some sort of 3d image?

Should we have an automatically optimizing network that finds the best hyper paramters over time using averages?

What other unique things can we do besides class balance and sensitivity to tune the algorithm?
